# Advent-of-Code-2022

This repository contains my solutions for [AoC 2022 :christmas_tree:](https://adventofcode.com/2022) written in Python.

It may not be the best looking code as I tried to still get some points for the JKU TNF Leaderboard.
Maybe I'll clean it up later.

## Requirements
I specified the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Make sure to keep an eye on it as I may update it during the event.
